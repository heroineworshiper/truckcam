A webcam is mounted on a lower part of the camera pole while the mane
gopro goes on top.  The webcam captures video for tracking & feeds it to
a raspberry pi.  The raspberry pi runs the tracking firmware & sends
commands over SPI to the truck's camera board.  SPI goes from SPI0_MOSI
to SWDIO on the cam board, SPI0_CLK goes to SWCLK on the cam board.
